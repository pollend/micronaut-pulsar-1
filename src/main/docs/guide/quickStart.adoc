To configure Apache Pulsar client you should first add the `micronaut-pulsar` module dependency:

dependency::micronaut-pulsar[groupId="io.micronaut.pulsar", version="{version}"]

You should then configure the URI of the Pulsar cluster or standalone server you wish to communicate with in `application.yml`:

.Configuring `pulsar.service-url`
[source,yaml]
----
pulsar:
  service-url: pulsar://localhost:6650
----
NOTE: As this module is based on official Java client from Apache Pulsar please visit
link:https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/client-libraries-java/#connection-urls[official documentation] for detailed
information on format of service URL.

Alternatively, `pulsar.service-url-provider` can be set using either `@PulsarServiceUrlProvider` or setting provider name
in `application.yml` as such:
[source,yaml]
----
pulsar:
  service-url-provider: BeanName
----
in which case implementing class must also have `@Named` annotation from micronaut core with value equal to the one in
YAML. In both cases bean must implement `org.apache.pulsar.client.api.ServiceUrlProvider` interface.
